**🌾 Analyzing Rainfall Impact on Agricultural Productivity — Power BI Project**

**📌 Introduction**
This Power BI project investigates the relationship between rainfall patterns and agricultural productivity across various Indian states and districts over the period 1966–2017. By visualizing and analyzing rainfall data alongside crop metrics such as rice cultivation area, the project aims to provide actionable insights that can help policymakers, farmers, and agronomists make data-driven decisions to improve agricultural yield and resilience against climate variability.

**🎯 Objectives**
Explore historical rainfall and agricultural data to detect key patterns and outliers.

Analyze correlations between monsoon rainfall (June–September) and crop productivity.

Build an interactive dashboard for multi-level filtering and strategic insights.

Recommend data-backed actions for improving agricultural outcomes.

**🛠️ Tasks Performed**
✅ Task 1: Data Exploration and Cleaning
Imported rain-agriculture.csv dataset into Power BI.

Profiled columns, handled missing and anomalous values.

Standardized and cleaned key fields like State Name, Year, and rainfall months.

**🔧 Task 2: Data Modeling & DAX Measures**
Built relationships (if applicable) and developed custom DAX measures including:

Total and Average Rainfall (June–September)

Crop Yield Metrics (Mean, Max, Min)

Applied time-based grouping for year-wise insights.

**📊 Task 3: Analytical Visualizations**
Trend analysis of rainfall across states and years.

Yield vs. Rainfall correlation using scatter plots.

Regional and seasonal insights through comparative visuals.

**📍 Task 4: Dashboard Development**
Created a dynamic and responsive Power BI dashboard with:

Line charts for rainfall trends.

Bar charts comparing rainfall and rice area.

Geo maps for regional yield differences.

Slicers for State, Year, Crop Type, and Season filters.

**💡 Task 5: Insights & Recommendations**
Identified patterns like rainfall deficits causing yield drops.

Suggested strategies for water resource planning and crop selection.

Included a narrative layer for stakeholders to interpret findings easily.

**🖥️ How to Use**
Download the .pbix file from this repository.

Open it using Microsoft Power BI Desktop (latest version recommended).

Use the interactive slicers to explore:

Rainfall vs. productivity across years and states.

How rainfall fluctuations affect rice cultivation.

Review the "Insights" section on the report for strategic recommendations.
